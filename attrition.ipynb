    "### The model initializes the centroids by default by taking in a string value of 'k-means++' for the parameter init. According to the documentation, k-means++ will select initial clusters in a smart way to speed up convergence. The smart way works as follows: choosing one center randomly from the data points and then measuring the distance between each data point and this center. Then we choose a new data point as a center based on the probability of the distance to the first center. The greater the distance, the higher the probability. Now we measure the distance between each data point to this new center. We keep on doing this until k number of centers have been chosen. It is better than randomly choosing starting centroids because there is a greater likelihood of nearby centers being chosen with random. k-means++, on the other hand, tries to make centers that are away from each other.

According to the documentation, max_iter is the Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a single run and tol is Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare convergence. If we are dealing with a large dataset, we must increase number of iterations and if we are dealing with a small dataset, we will not be able to reach the default 1x10^-4 tolerance and so we need to use less iterations or change the tolerance value. We need to adjust the tolerance and max_iter based on our input data because we are not aware of how far apart the datapoints are and so the cluster centers will not be correctly positioned and this will then affect the tolerance and the centroids wont fully converge. \n",

Firstly, points that have a large rate of change between them are in the underfitting region and points that have a small rate of change between them are in the overfitting region. So we have to look for a value of k that stops after the underfitting and stops before the overfitting. This means we are looking for a k that has great rate of change from the previous points but then doesnt have a great rate of change from the points to come (because if the points have a small rate of change that suggests we are experiencing diminishing returns by increasing k). Under this rubric, I would choose 2 as the value of k because it fulfills all the requirements.\n"

    "### There were 2 clusters produced. Cluster 0 had a low rate of attrition and Cluster 1 had a high rate of attrition. The clusters are built on various features such as Age, education, monthly income, % of attrition etc. The two clusters are separated by the % of attrition. There are two things that stand out when it comes attrition rate. Firstly, monthly income is very high for those in cluster 0 (low attrition) compared to those in cluster 1 (high attrition). This can be due to 3 factors. People in cluster 0 (low attrition) tend to be older than people in cluster 1 (high attrition), have been working for more years at the company, and are more educated. This suggests that the more educated you are the more years you work at the company, the higher your income will be. This could mean that people in cluster 1 (high attrition) are just starting out on the job and dissatisfied with their income, leave the company. My advice to HR would be to increase the salaries of junior employees by giving them better base salary or stock options and hire more educated employees since more educated employees have tend to shown lower attrition."
